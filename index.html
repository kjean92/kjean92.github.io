	<!-- About Me -->
	<section>
	<h2 class="border-top">About Me</h2>
        	<p> Prior to learning software engineering, I worked for several years as an Emergency Medical Services dispatcher. With long, irregular hours and frequent exposure to high-stress & traumatic situations, burnout and PTSD are common amongst emergency services workers. I hope to use the skills I'm learning through <a href="http://thinkful.com"> Thinkful </a> to create a product that makes self-care and mental health resources accessible to those that need it (in a fun, gamified package). </p>
        	<p> If you think I'd be a good fit for your team (whether as a software engineer or as the newest party member for your next Dungeons & Dragons campaign), please feel free to send me a message.
